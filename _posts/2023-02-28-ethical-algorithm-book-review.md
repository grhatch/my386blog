The Ethical Algorithm: The Science of Socially Aware Algorithm Design by Aaron Roth and Michael Kearns is a thought-provoking book that delves into the growing concern of ethical algorithm design. The authors provide insight into how algorithms can affect society and highlight the importance of designing algorithms that consider the ethical implications.

The book is a compelling read that will interest anyone who wants to understand the impact of algorithms on society. The authors provide a clear explanation of technical concepts without relying heavily on technical jargon, making it accessible to a wide range of readers. They also offer real-world examples of algorithmic bias and its consequences, demonstrating the urgent need for ethical algorithm design.

One of the strengths of the book is its holistic approach to the issue. The authors not only address the technical aspects of algorithm design but also the social, economic, and legal implications. They argue that algorithmic decision-making must be understood in its broader social context and provide insights into the challenges of creating socially aware algorithms. I love this about the book because it sparked interesting conversations between my friends and me. There are many aspects about ethics in algorithm design that I had never thought of. Not only did I emerge a better data scientist after reaing this book, but I also emerged a better member of my community with eyes open to issues that I have not seen before.

Although I did not experience any large flaws in this book, I do think it could benefit from more humor. Close to the end of the book, a few jokes were cracked, and I believe that including more humor throughout would have added a nice touch.

Overall, The Ethical Algorithm is a well-written and thought-provoking book that will appeal to a broad audience. Anyone interested in the social impact of technology and the need for ethical decision-making in the digital age will find it a valuable read. The authors provide a compelling case for why ethical algorithm design is critical, and their insights will help guide future efforts to create socially responsible algorithms.
