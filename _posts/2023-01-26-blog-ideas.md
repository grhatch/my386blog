For my first blog post, I will write a "how-to" on resolving merge conflicts in git.
For my data science ethics book, I will be reading "The Alignment Problem" by Brian Christian.
For my project in this class, I will scrape data from showchoir.com and other sources related to show choir. Maybe I'll collect chess data... We'll see what happens!
